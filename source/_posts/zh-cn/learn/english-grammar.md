- \[状语\]\[前置定语\]主语\[后置定语\] \[状语\]谓语\[状语\] \[前置定语\]宾语\[后置定语\]\[宾语补语\]\[状语\]
- \[前置定语\]主语\[后置定语\] 系动词 表语\[主语补语\]

例子:
1. 主语
   数词做主语: *Three* plus four equals seven.
2. 表语
   介词短语作表语: The story of my life may be *of help to others*
   不定式短语作表语: His plan is *to seek work in the city*. 其中 work 是 seek 的宾语, in the city 是 seek 的状语.
3. 宾语
   动名词短语作宾语: Do you mind *opening the window*?
4. 定语 (Attribute): 广义的形容词. 限定主语或宾语的范围. 修饰名词性的单词、短语、从句. 单词作定语时通常放在修饰名词前 (前置定语); 短语和从句作定语时通常放在所修饰名词后 (后置定语).
   名词作定语: They are *woman* workers.
   所有格名词作定语: *Tom's* father didn't write home until yesterday.
   形容词作定语: *Equal* pay for *equal* work shoud be introduced. 其中 for equal work 是 pay 的后置定语.
   代词、数词和介词短语作定语: This is *her first* trip *to Europe*.
5. 状语: 广义的副词. 修饰动词、形容词、副词. 表示地点、时间、原因、目的、结果、条件、让步、程度、方式、伴随情况等.
   副词作状语: These products are selling *quickly*. 这里 are 是助动词和 selling 组成复合谓语.
   名词作状语: He is in *keen* deep snow.
   介词短语作状语: The best fish swim *near the bottom*.

   比较状语从句 as...as:
   It is just *as foolish to say that one should never eat meat and potatoes together as it is to say that one should never eat bread or drink milk*. 这里 say 后面的都是同位语从句.
   让步状语从句 as 引出:
   The ants, *hard-working as they are*, have their times for play. hard-working 为表语成分, 放在从句句首构成倒装.
6. 宾语补语和主语: 有些及物动词作谓语, 除了要有宾语, 还需要宾语补语才能使句子意义完整. 宾语和宾语补语一起构成复合宾语. 如果是被动态语句, 宾语是实际主语, 宾语补语变为实际主语补语.
   分辨: 修饰主语/宾语的不是表示限定作用的定语, 那么就是补语.
   名词短语作宾语补语: They elected me *caption of the team*.
   形容词短语作宾语补语: He made me *ashamed of myself*. 形容词短语: 形容词+补语(介词短语, 不定式[短语).
   介词短语作宾语补语: We found everything there *in good order*.
   不定式短语作宾语补语: I should advise you *not to miss the chance*.
   分词短语作宾语补语: I could feel my heart *beating fast*.
   
   不定式短语作主语补语: The price is expected *to rise the near future*.
   形容词作主语补语: Some goods are left *unsold*.
   名词短语作主语补语: She was elected *director of public relations*.

### 五大句型

1. (SV) 主语 谓语(不及物动词)
   e.g. He cried.
2. (SVC) 主语 系动词 表语 \[主语补语\]
   e.g. The dinner smells good.
   e.g. This is an English-Chinese dictionary.
3. (SVO) 主语 谓语 宾语
   e.g. He enjoys reading
4. (SVOO) 主语 谓语 间接宾语(通常指人) 直接宾语(通常指物)
   e.g. He brought you a dictionary.
5. (SVOC) 主语 谓语 宾语 宾语补语
   宾语与宾语补语构成复合宾语, 存在意义上的主谓关系.
   e.g. I often find him at work.
   e.g. They painted the door green.

### 句子用途

英语句子按用途可分为陈述句、疑问句、祈使句、感叹句.

- 疑问句 Interrogative sentence
  有四类: 一般, 特殊, 选择, 反意
  - 一般疑问句 General question: 用 yes/no 来回答. 句中助动词 (包括情态动词) 要放在主语前, 形成到装. 特别情况下, 如表示猜测、惊异、怀疑时, 可以自然语序. 如:
    You think the boy is impossible?
  - 特殊疑问句 Special question: 就句中具体内容提出问题. 常用疑问词有 who\[m\], whose, which, what, where, when, why, how 等. 如:
    Who are responsible for the company's advertising?
    What does macaroni look like?
  - 选择疑问句 Alternative question: 提供两种或两种以上情况, 问对方选择哪一种. 通常有两个一般疑问句加 or 构成, 后一句常用省略结构. 如:
    Does your sister work in the wholesale department or in the retail store?
    Is the action necessary or unnecessary?
  - 反意疑问句 Disjunctive question: 附在陈述句后, 对陈述句叙述的事实提出相反疑问. 通常表示说话怀疑或没有把我, 要求 yes/no 回答. 但有时也用于加强语气, 并不要求回答.
    通常结构: {do,have,be,情态动词} + 主语; 若陈述句为否定结构, 反意疑问句用肯定结构.
    She doesn't often wash her hair, does she?
    Tom washed his car yesterday, didn't he?
    Everything is arranged in a good order, isn't it?
- 祈使句 Imperative sentence
  祈使句的主语 (听话者, 即 you) 通常被省略. 否定结构为在肯定结构前加 do not.
  用 let 引起的是第一人称祈使句, let us 表示说话者和听话者都包括在内; let me 则只指说话者一方.
  Let's start work at once.
- 感叹句 Exclamatory sentence
  由 how, what 感叹词加被强调部分及陈述句其他部分组成. 如:
  How hard he works!
  How lucky I am to be invited to the party!
  What an interesting role she played!
  What a pity it is to lose the game again!

### 三大从句

#### 定语从句

something 为先行词, 定语从句不能用 which

定语从句三要素: 先行词、关系词、关系词在从句中充当的成分.

1. 关系代词(who/whom/which/that/whose)引导的定语从句
   1. 先行词是人(用 who/whom/that)
      **The man** <u>who/that is standing there</u> is my English teacher. (在从句中作主语不可省略)
      **The man** <u>(whom/that) I am talking to</u> is from the US. (在从句中作宾语可省略)
   2. 先行词是物 (用 which/that)
      **The book** <u>which/that is on my desk</u> is the best saller of 2018. (在从句中作主语不可省略)
      **The book** <u>(which/that) I am reading</u> is the best seller of 2018. (在从句中作宾语可省略)
   3. 先行词是人或物具备的东西(用 whose)
      **The man** <u>whose hair is brown</u> is the chairman of the meeting.
      I am looking for **the book** <u>whose cover is red</u>.
   4. 只用 that 不用 which 的情况
      1. 多少: no, little, few, much
      2. 不定代词: some-, -thing, any-, all, every-, none, no-, neither...
      3. 唯一: the only, the one
      4. 恰好: the very/right + 先行词
      5. 人和物: 先行词中既有人又有物
         They talk about **the thing and people** <u>that were unforgetable</u>. (在从句中作主语不可省略)
      6. 最高级: 形容词最高级 + 先行词
      7. 序数词: 序数词 + 先行词
2. 关系副词(when/where/why)引导的定语从句
   1. 先行词是事件(用 when)
      I still remember **the day** <u>when we had the first class in this hall</u>.
   2. 先行词是地点(用 where)
      I still remember **the city** <u>where we visited ten years ago</u>.
   3. 先行词为原因(用 why)
      I don't know **the reason** <u>why you are absent from the meeting</u>.
   4. 关系副词 when, where, why = 介词 + which
      The house **in which**(=where) Lu Xun used the live is now a museum.
3. 非限制性定语从句
   1. 先行词与定语从句往往有逗号隔开, 不能用 that 引导
   2. 起补充说明的作用, 如果去掉, 主句的意思仍然清楚
      Jim passed the driving test, which surprised everybody in the office
4. as 引导的定语从句
   As is known to all, the earth is round.
   John, as you know, is a famous writer.
   He is from the south, as we can see from his accent.

#### 状语从句

状语从句在复合句中修饰主句、主句中的动词等.
由从属连词引导, 与主语连接, 常用逗号与主句分开. 如果位于句末, 其前一般不用逗号.
根据其用途可以分为时间状语从句、原因状语从句、结果状语从句、条件状语从句、让步状语从句、地点状语从句、目的状语从句.

1. 时间状语从句(when, while, as, before, after, since, until/till, as soon as...)
   1. when 的用法
      表示主句和从句动作同时或先后发生, 动词可以是延续性动词也可以是非延续性动词
      I worked for a foreign company when I was in Shanghai.
   2. while 的用法
      往往表示主句和从句中的动作同时发生, 且常用延续性或表示状态的动词.
      They rushed in while we were discussing problems.
   3. as 的用法
      as 引导时间状语从句表示一边...一边..., 随着, 或者正当...
      Helen heared the story as she washed clothes.
   4. before 和 after 的用法
      before 表示在...之前, after 表示在...之后.
      I will always work hard before I enter Peking University.
      She cooked several delicious dishes for me after I got to her home.
   5. until/till 的用法
      意思相同, 可以互换, 但 till 不能用于句首
      1. 主句谓语是延续性动词时. 主句用肯定形式, 表示这个动作或状态一直持续到 until/till 引导的从句的动作发生为止.
         I will wait for you untill/till you come to see me.
      2. 主句谓语是非延续性动词时, 主句用否定形式, 表示主句的动作直到 until 引导的从句动作发生才发生(构成 not...until 结构), 此时不能用 till. (有时不用 not, 而用其它表示否定的词, 如 never, nothing)
      I didn't go to bed until I finished my homework.
   6. since 的用法
      since 引导的时间状语从句, 一般主句用现在完成时, 从句用一般过去时.
      I have worked in this company since I graduated from Peking University.
   7. as soon as 的用法
      as soon as 引导的时间状语从句, 表示从句的动作一发生, 主句的动作也随之发生. 该从句一般用现在时表示将来时.
      I will tell him the truth as soon as he comes here.
2. 条件状语从句
   主句为祈使句、一般将来或含有情态动词时, 条件状语从句一般用现在时.
   1. if 引导的条件状语从句
      I will visit the Great Wall if it doesn't rain tomorrow.
   2. unless 引导的条件状语从句
      We'll go for an outing tomorrow unless it rains (=if it doesn't rain).
      
   注意: 为了强调动作的完成, 从句中也能用完成时.
   You can go out if you have finished your homework
3. 原因状语从句
   原因状语从句通常用 because, since 或 as 引导. 这三个词所表示的语气由 because 到 as 逐渐递减.
   1. because 的用法
      表示因果关系的语气最强, 用来回答 why 的问题, 所引出的原因往往是听话人所不知道或者感兴趣的, because 引导的原因状语从句往往显得比主句更重要.
      I'm leaving because I am fed up with the lecture.
      My friends admire me because I can speak English as fluently as the native speakers.
   2. since 的用法
      表示已知事实, 不需要强调的原因, 因此经常译成既然..., 通常放在句首. since 引导的从句是次要的, 重点强调主句的内容.
      Since every one is here, let's get started.
   3. as 的用法
      as 与 since 用法相似, 所引出的理由在说话人看来已经很明显, 或已为听话人所熟悉而不需要用 because 加以强调. as 引导的从句与主句具有同等的重要性.
      She didn't hear us come in as she was asleep. 
   4. now(that) 的用法
      主要用于口语, 表示微弱的原因, 主、从句因果关系不明显, 意为既然.
      Now(that) you have come, you may as well stay.
4. 目的状语从句
   1. 目的状语从句通常由 so that, in order that 等引导. 从句谓语中常含 may, might, can, could, will, would 等情态动词.
      He must get up early so that he can go to work on time.
   2. 当从句主语与主句主语一致时, 可用 so as to 和 in order to.
      He worked day and night in order that he could succeed.
      = He worked day and night in order to succeed.
5. 结果状语从句
   1. 由 so...that, such...that 引导
      so + 形容词或副词 + that
      so + 形容词 + a/an + 单数名词 + that
      such + a/an + 形容词 + 名词 + that
      such + 形容词 + 复数名词/不可数名词 + that
      
      She is such a lovely girl that we love her very much.
      = She is so lovely a girl that we love her very much.
      
      注意: 当名词前面有 many, much, little, few 修饰时, 用 so 不用 such.
      We have so much time that we can finish the work very well.
   2. so...that 句型的否定形式可用简单句 too...to... 或 not...enough to 代替.
      He is so young that he can't go to school.
      = He is too young to go to school.
      = He is not old enough to go to school.
6. 让步状语从句
   1. though/although 的用法
      同义, 一般情况下可互换, 但是 although 语气较重, 大多置于句首. 可与 yet 连用, 不可与 but 连用
      They are generous though they are poor.
      Although he was Japanese, he spent most of his life in China.
   2. even though 与 even if 的用法
      同义, 表示语气更强的让步.
      Even though he is 24 new, he's still like a little child.
      We'll make a trip even if/even though the weather is bad.
   3. wh-ever 类引导词的用法
      在英语中 wh-ever 既可引导名词性从句, 还可引导让步状语从句且可换成 no matter + 相应的 wh- 词, 而在引导名词性从句时只能用 wh-ever.
      Whenever I am unhappy, it is my friend who cheers me up.
      = No matter when I am unhappy, it is my friend who cheers me up.
7. 地点状语从句
   1. 引导地点状语从句的从属连词有 where 和 wherever.
      指具体地点时, 从句可位于主句之前或之后;
      表示抽象含义时, 从句需放在主句前面.
      He lives where the climate is cool.
      Where there is a will, there is a way.
   2. 注意区分 where 引导的状语从句和定语从句.
      You'd better make a mark where you have questions. (状语从句)
      You'd better make a mark **at the place** where you have questions. (有先行词, 定语从句)

注意:
1. 不能同时出现在一个句子中的连词:
   1. because (因为) 引导原因状语从句. so (所以) 连接并列句. 不能同时出现在一个句子里, 只能用其一.
      Because he was tired, he couldn't walk here.
      = He was tired, so he couldn't walk here.
   2. although/though (虽然) 引导让步状语从句. but (但是) 连接并列句. 不能同时出现在一个句子里, 只能用其一.
      但 although/though 和 yet 可以出现在一个句子里(这里的 yet 不是连词, 而是副词).
2. when, while, as 的区别
   when, while, as 引导的从句都可使用持续性动词. when 和 as 都可以与非持续性动词连用, 而 while 不能.
   when 可表示瞬间, 也可表示时间段, 与主句所陈述的动作、事情可同时发生, 也可有先后.
   while 常用于连接同时进行的两个持续性动词相伴随而发生的动作.
   as 不指先后, 尤指两个动作或事件同时发生.
   The film has been on when we arrived.
   My mother was cooking while I was doing my homework.
   As I left the house, I forgot the key.

#### 名词性从句

##### 引导名词性从句的连接词

1. 连接代词: who, whose, whom, what, which. 有词义, 在从句中充当句子成分, 如主语、表语、宾语等
2. 连接副词: when, where, why, how. 有词义, 在从句中充当句子成分, 作状语.
3. 连结词: that, whether, if, as if.
   that 无词义, 在从句中不充当句子成分, 有时可省略;
   而 whether, if, as if 虽有词义, 但在从句中不充当句子成分.

##### 主语从句

1. 主语从句在复合句中作主语.
   Who will go is not important.
2. **用 it 作为形式主语, 主语从句放在句末**,
   但 what 引导的主句从句表示...的东西时, 不用 it 做形式主语,
   whatever, whichever, whoever 一般也不用 it 做形式主语.
   It doesn't matter so much <u>whether you will come or not.</u>
   <u>What he needs</u> is more experience.
3. that 引导主语从句时不能省略
   <u>That he suddenly fell ill</u> made us surprised.

##### 表语从句

在句中做表语的从句称为表语从句, 共分三类常考点:
1. 若主句的主语是 advice, suggestion, order, request, requirement 等名词时, 则表语从句的谓语应用虚拟语气, 即 should + 动词原形的形式.
   His suggestion is that we (should) change our course.
2. 主语为 reason 时, 表语从句的连接词要用 that, 而不用 why 或 because.
   The reason for such a serious accident is that the driver was too careless and drunk.
3. because, why, as if/as though, as, like 等连接词也可以连接表语从句.
   He has lung cancer. That is because he has been smoking too much.

(应根据句子结构判断是表语从句还是结果状语从句)

##### 宾语从句

在主从复合句起宾语作用
宾语从句分为三类: 动词的宾语从句、介词的宾语从句和形容词的宾语从句.
根据不同的作用, 宾语从句的连结词通常分为以下几类:
1. that: 本身无意义, 只起连接作用, 口语中可以省略.
   He said (that) Kate was good at swimming.
2. what, which, who, whose, whom 等连接词, 在从句中作一定的成分, 如主语、宾语、表语、定语.
   I don't know what they are going to do. (这里的 what 作宾语)
   He asked me whose book it was. (这里的 whose 作定语)
3. when, where, why, how 等连接副词, 在从句中充当状语.
   Could you tell me where you live? (地点状语)
   Do you know how they found the place? (方式状语)
4. If, whether 意为是否, 不作句子成分, 但不能省略. (这里和条件状语的区分关键是宾语从句的事情已经做了, 而条件状语的事情还没做)
   He asked me if Miss Zhao was a teacher.

#### 同位语从句

起补充说明主语或宾语作用.
识别同位语从句: 1. 同位语从句是名词性从句; 2. 因为名词性所以同位语能替换主语或宾语, 而定语和补语不能.
如果修饰主语的同位语较长, 可以置于句子最后:
A *plan* was made last year *that several roads would be built in this part of the city*.

### 特殊句式

#### 虚拟语气

所有跟要求有关的动词后面宾语都用虚拟语气

1. if 引导的虚拟语气: if 条件句 + 结果句
   对现在虚拟: If were/did (过去式), would + 动词原形
   对过去虚拟: If had done (过去完成) , would have done
   对将来虚拟: If would do (过去将来时) , would do
2. 情态动词(should, ought to, need; 过去事实推测: can't/couldn't, must) + have ...
   as if/as though 表虚拟(描述与事实不符时)/表陈述(描述与事实相符时)

##### 虚拟条件句

1. 在含有虚拟条件句的复合语句中, 主句和从句的谓语都要用虚拟语气
   1. 违反现在事实
      (从句) `V2`, (主句) {`would`/`should`/`could`/`might`} `V1`
      If my brother were here, everything would be all right.
   2. 违反过去事实
      (从句) `had V3`, (主句) {`would`/`should`/`could`/`might`} `have V3`
      If you had taken my device, you wouldn't/couldn't) have failed in the exam.
   3. 违反将来事实
      (从句) {`V3`/`should V1`/`were to V1`}, (主句) {`would`/`should`/`could`/`might`} `V1`
      If it were Sunday tomorrow, I would/should/could/might/ go to see my grandma.
      If it were to snow this evening, they would not go out.
   4. 错综时间
      有时条件从句中动词和主语中的动作发生时间不一致, 这时动词形式要根据它所表示的时间加以调整
      If you had listened to doctor, you would be all right now. (从句过去动作, 主句现在动作)
   
   注意: 主句中 should 只用于第一人称(但在美语中 should 常被 would 代替); 从句中 should 可用于各种人称.
2. 虚拟条件句可以转换成下列形式
   1. 省略连词 if
      在书面中, 如果虚拟条件从句中有 were, had 或 should, 可以把 if 省略, 把这几个词放到主语之前, 构成主谓倒装.
      Should he come (If he should come), tell him to ring me up.
      Were I you (If I were you), I would not do it.
   2. 用介词短语代替条件状语从句
      有时假设的情况并不用条件从句表示出来, 而是通过介词短语来表示.
      Without air (If there were not air), there would be no living things.
      But for your help (If it hadn't been for your help), I couldn't have done it.
      假设的情况有时可以通过上下文或其他方式表达出来.
      I was busy that day. Otherwise I would have gone with them.
      (If I hadn't been busy that day, I would have gone there with them).
      I would have finished the work, but I have been ill.
      (If I hadn't been ill, I would have finished the work.)
   3. 省去条件状语从句
      表示虚拟从句的主句或从句有时可以省略, 但其含义仍可以推知.
      1. 省去条件从句
         (If you had wanted to,) You could have washed your clothes yourself. 
      2. 省去主句(常用于表示愿望)
         If my grandma were with me!
         If only she had not left.

##### 虚拟语气的其他用法

1. 虚拟语气在主语从句的用法
   在 It is important(strange, natural, necessary)/suggested/desired/proposed...that... 句型中, that 所引导的主语从句的谓语动词常用 should + 动词原形的结构.
   It is important that every member (should) inform himself of these rules.
2. 虚拟语气在宾语从句的用法
   1. 在动词 wish 后的宾语从句中表示与现在或过去的事实相反或对将来的主观愿望, 从句通常省略连词 that
      1. 表示对现在情况的虚拟: 从句动词用过去式或过去进行时(be + were)
         I wish I knew the answer to the question.
      2. 表示对过去情况的虚拟: 从句动词常用 had+过去分词.
         I wish(wished) I hadn't spent so much money.
      3. 表示对将来的主观愿望: 谓语动词为 would+动词原形.
         此时要注意, 主句主语与从句主语不能相同, 因为主句主语所期望的从句动作能否实现取决于从句主语的态度和意愿(非动物名称除外).
         I wish it would stop.
         I wish you would come soon.
   2. 在 suggest, demand, order, propose, insist, command, request, desire 等动词后面的宾语从句中, 谓语动词用 should + 动词原形.
      I demand that he (should) answer me immediately.
      * 注意: 当 suggest 表示暗示, 表明之意, insist 表示坚持认为之意时, 其后宾语从句不适用虚拟语气形式, 应使用陈述语气形式.
        The smile on his face suggested that he was satisfied with our work.
        The man insisted that he had never stolen the money.
   3. 在 would rather 后的宾语从句中, 也用虚拟语气, 其谓语为动词过去式(表示现在或将来动作)或过去完成时(表示过去动作)
      I would rather she came tomorrow.
      He would rather I had done the work for him.
3. 虚拟语气在状语从句中的用法
   1. 在带有 even if/even though 引导的让步状语从句的主从复合句中, 主句和从句都用虚拟语气, 动词形式与含有非真实条件的虚拟语气相同.
      Even if he had been ill, he would have gone to his office.
   2. 由 as if 或 as though 引导的状语从句表示比较或方式时. 从句谓语形式为动词的过去式(be + were)或 had + 过去分词.
      He treated me as if I were a stranger.
      She talked about the film as if she had really seen it.
   3. 在 in order to 或 so that 引导的目的状语从句中, 谓语动词多用 could 或 might (有时也用 should) + 动词原形.
      Mr. Green spoke slowly so that His students could(might) hear clearly.
4. 虚拟语气在定语从句中的用法
   在 it is time (that)... 句型中, 定语从句的谓语常用虚拟语气表示将来时, 动词原形一般换成过去式, 意思是该做某事的时候了.
   It's (high) time we did our homework.
5. 虚拟语气在简单句中的用法
   1. 情态动词过去式用于现在时态, 表示说话人的谦虚、客气、有礼貌, 或委婉的语气, 常见于日常会话中.
      I would be better for you not to stay up too late.
   2. 在一些习惯表达中.
      I would rather not tell you.
   3. 用 may + 动词原形, 表示祝愿, 此时 may 必须置于句首(多用于正式文体中).

#### 非谓语动词

不可单独作谓语. 非谓语动词有三种: 不定式、分词和动名词.

##### 不定式 Infinitive

1. 构成 to V1 (to 是不定式的符号, 无意义, 有时可省略).
   不定式具有动词特点, 可以有自己的状语和宾语 (及物动词), 组成不定式短语, 但没有三单和复数形式.
   如 to read the text slowly.

   不定式前可加某些疑问代词, 如 who, what, which; 或疑问副词如 when, where, how, why 等. 构成特殊的不定式短语.
   如 what to do next, how to get there.

   不定式还可有逻辑主语, 构成另一种特殊的不定式短语. 它由 "for 名词 不定式" 组成.
   如 for the children to watch TV, for us to look for a job.
2. 用法
   不定式可作主语、主语补语、表语、宾语、宾语补语、定语、状语.
   1. 作主语
      *To learn English* is not easy for me.
      不定式短语作主语时, 往往放在最后面, 而用 it 作为形式主语. 其结构为 It be adj. \[for/of sb.\] 动词不定式
      如上句可改为 It is not easy for me *to learn English*.
   2. 作主语补语
      复合宾语中不定式作宾补时, 若变为被动语态, 原宾语变为主语, 原宾语补语变为主语补语.
      不定式作主语补语时, 不能省略 to.
      He was asked *to maek a speech at the meeting.*
      They were made *to work day and night*.
   2. 作表语
      My work is *to clean the room everyday*.
   3. 作宾语
      What sport does he like *to play*? He likes *to play football*.
      
      不定式常作某些及物动词的宾语, 不能作介词的宾语 (but, expect 除外).
      这些动词常常表示命令、打算或希望. 这些及物动词有: would like, want, like, wish, hate, hope, continue, manage, try, offer, start, begin, forget, promise, mean (打算), pretend, intend (想要), decide, learn, desire, agree, care, choose (愿意), refuse, fail, plan, expect 等.
      Would you like *to see a film this evening*?
      
      如果谓语为 find/think 后跟不定式作宾语时, 常用 it 作形式宾语, 而将真正的宾语放在最后面.
      I find it hard *to write English articles*.
      注意: 不定式常和疑问代词/副词 what, which, when, where, how 作不定式短语的宾语, 在句法中作宾语从句.
      The kid doesn't know *how to do it himself*. (= how he should do it himself.)
   4. 作宾语补语
      不定式作宾补时与宾语有逻辑上的主动关系.
      Lucy asked him *to turn down the radio*.
      有些及物动词的宾语后常有不定式作宾语补语, 构成复合宾语, 这样意义才能完整. 这些及物动词有 tell, ask, invite, force, get (让), allow, wish, want, hate, help, leave, expect, prefer, advise, presuade, permit, remind, request, order, warn, mean (打算), cause, allow, would like, encourage 等.
      Would you like us *to go with you*.
      He asked you *to call him back at 11*.

      还有一些使役动词和感官动词也用不定式作宾补. 这时要省略 to. 这些动词有:  一感 (feel, notice), 二听 (hear, listen to), 三让 (let, make, have), 四看 (look at, see, watch, notice), 但是这些动词变被动语态时, 作动词的不定式必须加上 to
      The boss made them *work the whole night*.
      They were made *to work the whole night* by the boss.
   5. 作定语
      不定式作定语应放在被修饰名词之后 (只作后置定语), 它与被修饰名词之间有逻辑上的被动关系.
      We don't have enough food *to eat*.
      如果不定式是不及物动词, 且与所修饰词间有被动关系, 需在不定式后加上适当介词.
      There is nothing *to worry about*.
      Do you have any ink *to write with*?
      It is a very good school *to study in*.
   6. 作状语
      不定式作状语, 用来修饰动词、形容词、副词或整个句子. 通常表示目的、结果、原因、程度等.
      1. 作目的状语
         *To save the time*, we took the plane to Beijing.
         注意: 如果强调此目的, 可在不定式前加 in order/so as. 但 so as to 不能用于句首.
         I will take notes *in order not to/so as not to forget these important points*.
      2. 作结果状语, 往往表示出乎意料的结果, 常与 only 连用
         He hurried to the station *only to find that the train had left*.
         著名的 too...to...句式
         It is too late *to do anything now*.
      3. 作原因状语
         *To hear him talk to me in that manner*, you would think that the is my boss.
         接在某些形容词后面常表示喜怒哀乐的原因.
         We are pround *to be the citizens of China*.
      4. 作程度状语
         He is old enough *to go to school*.
         Mary wouldn't be so careless as *to forget her key*.
3. 时态与语态
   1. 一般现在时
      表示不定式的与主要谓语动词的动作或状态几乎同时或在其后发生.
      She was seen *to enter the hall*. (seen 与 to enter 两个动作同时发生)
      I have some news *to tell you*. (to tell 动作发生在 have 之后)
   2. 现在进行时
      表示不定式动作正在进行且与谓语表示的动作同时发生.
      They seem *to be getting along quite well*.
      They are said *to be building another bridge across the river*. 据说他们正在这条河上修建另一座大桥.
   3. 现在完成时
      表示不定式动作发生在谓语动作之前.
      I am sorry *to have hept you waiting*. (to have kept 发生在 am 表示的时间之前)
      She seems *to have read the book before*.
   4. 被动语态
      当不定式的逻辑主语是该不定式动作的承受者时, 不定式一般要用被动形式.
      Is is an honour for me *to be asked to speak here*.
      He wanted the letter *to be mailed at once*.

      但在某些句子中, 虽然不定式与最近的名词与动宾关系, 但与句中另一个名词却可能有主谓关系. 这时不定式常用主动式.
      He has no one *to take care of*. (He 与 to take care of 有主谓关系)
      We still have many difficulties *to overcome*.
      Give him some books *to read, please.
      They found the lecture hard *to understand*.

##### 动名词

动名词兼有名词特性, 可作主语, 比如:
Thus forming an integrated image *with all the information placed in a single mental picture* can help us to preserve a memory.
独立结构 with + n. (all the information) + V3 (placed \[in a single mental picture\]) 作方式状语修饰动名词短语 forming an integrated image.
(作主语、宾语、表语、定语)
构成: 动词原形+ing, 但是有不规则形式.
用法:
1. 作主语:
   谓语动词用单数.
   <u>Eating too much</u> is bad for your health.
3. 作宾语:
   表示一般的习惯或抽象行为或经常性的动作.
   1. 作动词宾语
      I like <u>playing basketball</u> very much.
   2. 作介词宾语
      英语中有一些动词(短语)后面常跟动名词作宾语. 常用的有 finish, enjoy, mind, miss, be worth, practice,
      have trouble/problems/difficulty (in), spend some time/money (in), feel like, be/get used to.
      Stamps are used for <u>sending letters</u>.

##### 分词 Participle

分词的作用相当于形容词, 在句中可以担当定语、表语、状语、补语.

1. 现在分词 (present participle) 与过去分词 (past participle)
   现在分词 V+ing; 过去分词 V+ed, 但有不规则形式.
   现在分词有主动、进行之意; 过去分词有被动、完成之意.
2. 用法
   1. 作定语
      单个分词常放在修饰名词前, 分词短语常放在被修饰名词后. 但有时过去分词也可放在被修饰名词之后.
      现在分词作定语修饰其逻辑主语; 过去分词作定语修饰其逻辑宾语.
      Do you know the girl *standing under the tree*?
      Please hand in your *written* exercises.
      They decided to change the material *used*. (单个过去分词作后置定语)
   2. 作状语
      表示时间、原因、方式、结果、条件、让步和伴随情况等.
      作状语的分词通常放在句首或句尾, 有时也可插在主谓直接.
      分词作状语其逻辑主语为句子的主语.
      *Relying on our own efforts*, we overcame all the difficulties. (原因)
      *Hearing the news*, they all jumped with joy. (时间)
      The teacher walked about the classroom, *using his hands* to help him in his explanation. (方式)
      The child fell, *striking his head against the door and cutting it*. (结果)
      The students went out of the school, *laughing and talking* (方式或伴随情况)
      *Given better attention*, the trees could grow better. (条件)

      为了表示明确时间或条件, 有时可在分词前加 when, while, if 等连词.
      *When leaving the airport*, she waved again and again to us.
      *While waiting for the train*, I had a long talk with Jane.
      *If translated word by word*, the sentence will be meaning less.

      当主句和从句主语不一致且要用分词作状语时 (称为独立结构 absolute construction), 要在分词前面加上动作的逻辑主语. 在很多情况下表示时间、原因、条件或伴随情况.
      *The hoildays being over*, they began to get down to do their work again. (时间)
      *So many people being absent*, we decided to put the meeting off. (原因)
      *Weather permitting*, the football match will be played on Wednesday. (条件)
      We went far into the forest, *her father acting as guide*. (伴随)
      有时这样的独立结构还可用介词 with 引导.
      He stood there *with his hands crossed before him*.
      *With tears rolling down her cheeks*, she carefully covered her mother's body with sand.
   3. 作表语
      分词常在系词后作表语.
      现在分词表示主语的性质、特征; 过去分词表示某种状态.
      The book is so *interesting* that I will read it again.
      The boy is too *frightened* to move.
   4. 作补语
      现在分词作补语, 被补足的宾语/主语是它的逻辑主语
      过去分词作补语, 被补足的宾语/主语是它的逻辑宾语 (因为过去分词有被动含义)
      分词可在 see, hear, notice, watch, keep, find, get, have, feel 等动词后与一个名词构成复合宾语.
      Don't keep us *waiting for a long time*.
      I heard him *singing in the classroom*.
      He'll have his hair *cut after school*.

      当谓语变为被动语态时, 原宾语变为主语, 原宾语补语变为主语补语.
      The hall was found *thoroughly cleaned* and everything *arranged in good order*.
      The children were heard *singing the song*.

      在 see, hear, notice, watch, feel 等动词后既可用现在分词也可用不带 to 的不定式作宾语补语. 现在分词强调动作正在进行和发展中, 而不定时表示动作的全过程已经结束.
      She saw the man *getting on the truck*. 她看见那个人在往卡车上爬.
      She saw the man *get on the truck and drive off*. 她看见那个人爬上卡车并把车开走了.
      &mdash;Do you hear someone *knocking at the door*?
      &mdash;Yes, I heared him *knock three times*.
3. 现在分词的时态和语态
   |        | 主动      | 被动           |
   | --     | --        | --             |
   | 一般式 | V+ing     | being V3       |
   | 完成式 | having V3 | having been V3 |
   1. 完成时
      现在分词的完成时主要用在状语中, 表示该动作在谓语动作之前发生.
      *Having done his homework*, the boy began to watch TV.
      *Having watered the vegetables*, the farmer took a short rest.
   2. 被动式
      现在分词的被动式不仅表示被动, 而且表示这个动作正在发生, 或与谓语动作同时发生.
      现在分词被动式主要用于定语、状语和宾语补语.
      The bridge *being built there* will be one of the longest in China. (正在进行, 定语)
      *Being surrounded*, the enemy were forced to put down their guns. (正在进行, 状语)
      He found the topic *being discussed everywhere*. (being discussed 与 found 同时发生, 宾语补语)
   3. 完成时被动式
      现在分词的完成时被动式不仅表示被动, 而且表示这个动作在谓语动作之前发生.
      这种形式常用作状语.
      *Having been given such a good chance*, how could she give it up?
      *Having been told that some guests were coming*, she shopped all morning in that supermarket.

##### 易混淆点

1. 动词不定式复合结构用 of 或 for 的区别
   在 kind, good, nice, clever 等表示人的品质、特征的形容词后, 不用 for 而用 of;
   在表示事物性质特点的形容词后用 for.
   It's very clever <u>of</u> you <u>to do it like this</u>.
   It's very difficult <u>for</u> me <u>to finish the task in an hour</u>.
2. 不定式符号 to 和介词 to 的区别
   to 既可以是不定式的符号, 也可以是介词, 后面跟名词、代词或动名词作宾语.
   常用的含有介词 to 的短语:
   make a contribution to
   devote...to...
   prefer...to...
   get/be used/accustomed to...
   apply to
3. 动词不定式作宾补和现在分词作宾补的区别
   see, watch, hear, feel 等感官动词
   后接省略 to 的不定式作宾补时, 表示动作的全过程已经结束;
   后接现在分词作宾补, 表示动作正在进行.
   I saw him <u>cross the street</u>.
   I saw him <u>crossing the street</u>
4. 某些动词后面接不定式和动名词有区别
   stop, forget, remember, try, regret, mean, go on, can't help
5. need, require, want 后面跟不定式和动名词作宾语的区别
   后面接动名词主动式表示被动含义, 也可跟不定式的被动式.
   The window needs <u>cleaning</u>.
   The window needs <u>to be cleaned</u>.

#### 动词形态

##### 时态和语态

英语动词从时间 (time) 上看有现在、过去、将来机过去将来; 从体 (aspect) 上看有一般、进行、完成及完成进行. 动词的时间与体的结合即动词时态 (verb tense).
在十六种时态中, 将来完成进行时 (future perfect continusus tense)、过去将来进行时 (past future continuous tense)、过去将来完成时 (past future perfect tense)、过去将来完成进行时 (past future perfect continuous tense) 很少使用.

分清句子时态: 过去的过去用过去完成时; 见到一段时间用完成时

谓语动词有主动和被动两种语态. 主动语态 (active voice) 表示主语是动作执行者, 被动语态 (passive voice) 表示主语是动作的承受者, 宾语是动作的执行者.
被动语态一共有十二种, 但实际常用的只有八种.

不定式的主动式时态有一般现在时, 现在进行时和现在完成时三种. 被动式时态有一般现在时和现在完成时两种.

例如 She told John that she liked his tie 中, 从句的谓语 like 用了过去时, 这并不是说她现在已经不喜欢 John 的领带了. 而是因为主句的谓语是过去时.
规则: 从句谓语由一般现在时变成一般过去时, 一般过去时变为过去完成时, 一般将来时变成过去将来时. 即
主句现在时态, 从句该用什么时态用什么.
主句过去时态, 分情况讨论:
1. 从句动作若在主句动作发生之前, 从句用过去完成时态.
2. 从句的动作与主句动作同时发生, 用一般过去时或过去完成时.
   I thought the experiment *was going on* now.
3. 从句动作发生在主句动作之后, 从句用过去将来时
   She siad the apparatus *would be* available next week.

以下情况可不遵守时态呼应的规则:
1. 客观真理, 自然现象, 格言谚语.
   The boys learned yesterday that the planets *are circling* about the sun. (不用 were circling)
2. 从句中有表示绝对过去时间的状语.
   The old man said he *joined* the Red Army in 1933. (不用 have joined)
3. 说话者强调动作现在正在进行或将要发生.

##### 被动语态的用法

1. 在被动语态的句子中, 动作的执行者一般由介词 by 引起的短语来表示.
   We often help them. (主动)
   They are often helped by us. (被动)
2. 被动语态常用于一下情况
   1. 当不知道动作执行者是谁或没有必要提到动作执行者.
      Paper was first made in China.
      No decision *has been made* so far.
   2. 当强调或突出动作承受者的作用时. 此时动作执行者用介词 by 加代表动作执行者的名词或代词表示.
      The new machine was invented by a 20-year-old young worker.
2. 被动语态的几种特殊结构
   1. 不及物动词、表状态动词一般用主动语态(即不能作被动)
      come true, consist of, take place, happen, become, rise, occur, belong, break out, appear, arrive, die, fall, last, exist, fail, succeed
   2. 含情态动词的被动语态结构: 情态动词 + be + 及物动词的过去分词.
      The goods *must be shipped* before the end of September.
      In this sense, bad things *can be turned* into good things.
   3. 短语动词的被动语态结构.
      短语动词应作为一个整体看待, 变为被动语态不能丢弃构成短语动词的介词、副词或名词等成分.

      变为被动:
      *He* was allowed *an hour* to get to the airport.
      或者:
      *An hour* was allowd *him* to get to the airport.

      主动结构中如有复合宾语 (宾语+宾语补语), 变为被动结构时只将元复合宾语中的宾语变为主语, 宾语补语部分不变, 但语法上变为主语补语 (subject complement).
      We advised *him to practice speaking English*.

         Glass breaks easily.
         The car rides/drives smoothly.
         The case locks easily.
         The book sells well.
      2. 系动词(look, sound, feel, smell, taste, appear, seem, turn, keep, ...):

      5. 表示事物(或人)客观上"需要": want, need, require 作谓语
         用动名词作宾语一般主动形式表示被动含义. (等价于动词不定式的被动形式)
         若动名词是不及物动词, 后面还需跟上相应的介词.
      6. 某些作表语的形容词(easy, difficult, light, heavy, fit, good, safe, comfortable, dangerous, pleasant, ...)后面(作状语)的动词不定式主动表被动
         如 She is easy to approach
      6. have sb. do sth. 和 have sb./sth. doing 和 have sth. done 的区别
         1. have sb. do sth.
            让某人做某事, have 可用 let, make 代替. 不定式往往表示一次性的动作, 且强调动作已经完成或尚未发生.

         2. have sb./sth. doing
            让某人或某物一直做某事, have 可用 keep 代替, 现在分词往往具有持续、进行、主动的含义.
            The teacher <u>had the students reading aloud the text</u> for a quarter.
            The two men <u>had their lights burning</u> all night long.
         3. have sth. done
            有两层含义:
            1. 托某人做(=ask sb. to do sth.)
               The driver <u>had hist car washed</u> once a week.
            2. 遭受某人做. 过去分词的动作由他人完成, 被动含义且强调动作已完成.
               He <u>had his wallet stolen</u> when he was shopping.
