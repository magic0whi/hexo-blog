目前受到{% post_link tricks-of-heart 性别焦虑 %}的影响, 属于 <font color=#5BCFFA>M</font>t<font color=#F5ABB9>F</font> 群体.

When a child is not insecure, they don't succumb the danger. If you make her confident who she is that she is amazing the way she is. She will not succumb to other people and that is how she would navigate.

Ultimately I believe the biggest miss in the world is people focusing on things don't matter and underestimating the things matter.
Focusing the things that matter most and building up self-esteem around that. And then, suffocating and muting the stuff society values, because in reality long term it doesn't matters much.
